  <p><strong>Author's note:</strong> The rest of this policy is <a href="https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/live.php?token=BHwc8erjEw8KM6IlUykoJDS1UGjvuh9l">a pretty generic privacy statement that I found online</a>. But in the interests of clarity and transparency, all you really need to know is that I'm using a basic Google Analytics setup to get a rough idea of my visitor numbers, and have Google Adsense set up to run ads on one page (the Weekly-Monthly Rental Rate Converter). I don't personally serve any custom tracking cookies beyond what Google is using. The site does use your browser's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a> to remember your decision if you change the default external link behaviour or the style-switcher in the config panel, but that's about it. It's a static site served from <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, so I don't maintain server logs, though GitHub might.</p>
