		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
		<p>This is a selection of some of my recent work for <a href="http://www.distilled.net/" target="_blank">Distilled</a>. While I enjoy handling both design and development, due to the resource availability of our creative team I have been primarily responsible for just the development for most of these pieces, although I generally have a hand in shaping the UI design. <strong>N.B.</strong> Unfortunately I&rsquo;m unable to showcase some of my favourite work here due to non-disclosure agreements.</p>
