It was written for the <a href="http://www.mag.org.nz/">MAG</a>/<a href="http://www.tagairsoft.co.nz/">TAG</a> Mil-Sim Competition in late 2010, and was the winning competition entry. In retrospect, it's a little embarassing for its Tom-Clancy-lite pretensions, but hey.</p><p>It should go without saying but it is a work of fiction, and any resemblances to real people are purely coincidental - even the obvious references.</p></aside><section id=memo><div class=postContent><div class=postContentInner><p style=text-align:right>3 December 2015</p><h5>MEMORANDUM FOR: Commander, Quick-Response Force, Counter-Terrorist Unit, Washington D.C. 20318-9999</h5><h5>SUBJECT: Operation Heart of Darkness</h5><p>The following documents contain an <a href=#intelligence class=scroll title="Scroll to Intelligence section">intelligence briefing</a> and <a href=#orders class=scroll title="Scroll to Orders section">orders</a> for today's CTU operations. Attachments include an <a href=#appendix class=scroll title="Scroll to Message Intercept">intercepted message</a> from the primary target and a <a href=#map class=scroll title="Scroll to attached Map">map of the AO</a>. Study all documents carefully and report back with any queries.</p><h6 id=intelligence>Intelligence</h6><p><span class=censored>Since the election of our first black president,</span> the rift between Northern progressives and Southern fundamentalist Christians has widened <span class=censored>further than anyone thought remotely plausible.</span></p><p><span class=censored>The</span> global financial crisis of 2007 <span class=censored>left in its wake thousands of Americans without a job or means of support, while the federal government busily handed over billions of their dollars to bankers on Wall Street. In the southern Bible Belt - already</span> an area filled with unease by the sudden changes taking place in modern American society <span class=censored>- conservative leaders were quick to seize upon their frustration and anger. Evangelist Pat Robertson played on ordinary peoples' fear of change and</span> whipped fundamentalists into a frenzy <span class=censored>of bigotry, racism and homophobia. Meanwhile, pundits Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck drew parallels between the administration and Nazi Germany, and</span> called for all 'real Americans' to defend their way of life against an allegedly tyrannical government.</p><p>Grass-roots movements such as the 'Tea Party' began forming, <span class=censored>protesting Obama initiatives such as health-care and energy reform.</span> While most of these movements were peaceful and non-violent, their ranks included minority elements of militant right-wing extremists, <span class=censored>who began arming themselves for confrontation with the perceived threat from big government and liberal elites.</span></p><p><span class=censored>In September 2011, the slowly-recovering economy took a second nose-dive shortly before the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, and hard-line conservatives began to look for alternative means of representation. The</span> number of domestic terrorist attacks skyrocketed, <span class=censored>as disenfranchised individuals unleashed their frustration on government buildings, abortion clinics and other symbols of the liberal majority.</span></p><p><span class=censored>In response, America turned to the polls,</span>reelecting President Obama in 2012<span class=censored>by a slim majority. Emboldened by the win,</span> the administration was granted sweeping new powers <span class=censored>and a mandate to crack down on the growing civil unrest. Since the winter of 2013, military checkpoints have become a common sight in the Deep South, and right-wing figureheads such as Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin have been imprisoned. However, the government's reaction only validated conservative fears,</span> and turned Beck and Palin into anti-establishment heroes. Their imprisonment initiated waves of suicide bomb attacks<span class=censored>by religious extremists bent on a heroic martyr's death. Beck's prediction of 'an Obama dictatorship', which seemed ridiculous back in 2009, has increasingly resembled reality.</span></p><p><span class=censored>In recent months</span> the number of concerning right-wing militias has exploded, <span class=censored>vastly exceeding the US Secret Service's ability to keep track of them all. As a result,</span> the responsibility for managing threats from domestic terrorism has been spread across various federal agencies including the Department of Homeland Security's Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU), <span class=censored>which currently maintains files on over a dozen anti-government factions.</span></p><p><span class=censored>One such element is</span> the Trinity Legion, a militia of right-wing survivalists, anti-government activists and religious fundamentalists. Their leader is Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, <span class=censored>a retired US Army officer who believes he has a mission from God to bring about the biblical apocalypse. He is a</span> veteran of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan with a background in bio-weapons, <span class=censored>and has spent the last few years arming and training his militia in guerilla warfare. The group has kept a low profile since they were suspected in last year's Chicago Fed Building attack, and have constructed a guerilla camp deep within the pine forests of northern Georgia.</span></p><h6 id=orders>Orders</h6><p>At 0549 yesterday, CTU response teams were placed on high alert when the NSA intercepted a message purportedly from Kurtz himself (see <a href=#appendix class=scroll title="Scroll to Message Intercept">appendix</a>, attached), in which he orders the Legion to commence an attack.</p><p><span class=censored>Shortly afterwards, the main research centre at the</span> CDC headquarters <span class=censored>in Atlanta, GA was</span> infiltrated by at least seven well-armed and masked terrorists, <span class=censored>who were able to</span> steal several vials of weapons-grade virus <span class=censored>material before detonating diversionary explosives in the guard barracks and escaping. Their objective appears to have been a highly contagious experimental virus known as THX1138, which is</span> designed for airborne transmission using a bomb to hasten the initial release. <span class=censored>It is still unclear exactly what effects the virus has as human trials have not yet been conducted, however it is intended to attack the cerebral cortex causing irrational rage, loss of motor function, impaired reasoning, a lessened response to pain sensation and finally</span> death.</p><p><span class=censored>Intelligence indicates that</span> the terrorists have returned to the Trinity Legion camp to weaponize the virus. <span class=censored>If combined with a dirty bomb, it could be spread by the wind over a massive area,</span> potentially infecting millions of people.<span class=censored>However before the bomb can be detonated,</span> the virus must be activated <span class=censored>in a complex chemical process requiring</span> several hours to complete. Our mission is to secure and destroy the virus sample before the virus can be activated and dispersed.</p><p><span class=censored>CTU's quick-reaction force will be one of the first government response teams deployed to the area.</span> Attached to the team is Agent Marlow, a biological warfare expert <span class=censored>from USAMRIID. He is</span> the only member of the team with the expertise necessary <span class=censored>to identify and safely deactivate the virus bomb for transportation. However</span> it is of vital importance that he be protected at all costs, <span class=censored>as if he is captured by the Legion then they might be able to greatly accelerate the virus activation process with his forced cooperation.</span></p><p><span class=censored>One more thing: remember to</span> check your fire <span class=censored>storming the Trinity Legion camp. Intelligence indicates that there may be</span> unarmed civilians in the compound, <span class=censored>including women and children. The last thing this government needs is another Waco siege on our hands, so you are to proceed with caution.</span></p><p><span class=censored>Your</span> transport to the AO is via UH-60s <span class=censored>courtesy of the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, who will be able to</span> drop your team less than a klick from the target. Jump-off time is 0900, and ETA at the LZ is 0930. Once you have identified and captured the package, your orders are to withdraw to a safe LZ for extraction. <span class=censored>Further information will be provided over the radio as the situation develops.</span> Good luck.</p><img style="border:none; padding:0; background:none; margin:0 0 -120px" src=/img/heartOfDarkness/sig.795a.png width=206 height=211 alt=Signiature><p style="padding:0 0 30px 42px"><span class=censored>Fresleven N.</span> Manager<br>General<span class=censored>, US Army</span><br><span class=censored>Commander</span></p><p style=font-size:14px><br><br>Encls<br></p><p style=font-size:14px>1.
