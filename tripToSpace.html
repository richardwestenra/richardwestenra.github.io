		<p>Last week I went for two trips to space. The first one was on a private spacecraft. I won it through a competition on the back of a cereal box or something. It was really fun.</p>
		<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" title="Photo of me on the private spacecraft" src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/tripToSpace/photos-from-my-trip-to-space-3.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="298"></p>
		<p>This photo was taken aboard the private spacecraft. At this point being in space was still pretty new for me, so I was fairly excited about it.</p>
		<p>When I got back to Earth, NASA wanted me for another mission. This time we went to the International Space Station. I wasn’t busy or anything so I agreed to go. It was really fun too.</p>
		<br/>
		<p><img class="size-full alignright" title="Photo of me with the NASA space shuttle" src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/tripToSpace/photos-from-my-trip-to-space-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="503">This picture is of me with the NASA space shuttle. We made some mission critical upgrades to some mission critical systems and went on a mission critical space walk. This was my first time doing a space walk. It was pretty neat.</p>
		<p>Sorry if the photo is hard to make out. It’s tricky taking photos in space because of all the mission critters!</p>
		<br/>
		<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp583" title="Doing a spacewalk near the ISS over New Zealand with Rob and Chris" src="{{site.baseurl}}assets/images/tripToSpace/photos-from-my-trip-to-space-2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375"></p>
		<p>In this picture I am hanging out with Rob and Chris who are two other astronauts. We are attaching a new truss segment to the ISS and beginning to upgrade the power grid or something like that. I like this photo because you can see my house in the background.</p>
		<p>After the upgrades were done we flew home. Then I woke up and realised it was all a dream.</p>
		<p>Anyway I hope you like my pictures. I am glad I brought my camera, otherwise my friends would never believe that I really went to space in my dream.</p>
